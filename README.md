# Usage
Run the 'autorun.bat' and select .tactpkg files in Rebirth of Souls' '/Motion/' folder. It will create a subfolder named after the tactpkg file containing all of the extract TMO animation files.

To use the animations in Blender, download and install the Bleach RoS blender plugin: https://github.com/Al-Hydra/BlenderTMD2

After importing a TMD2 model into your scene, simply drag the TMO animations you want into Blender and they will be setup/applied to the model. Note that the Blender plugin does not fully support animations yet, so some bones will be rotated incorrectly until full support is added.
